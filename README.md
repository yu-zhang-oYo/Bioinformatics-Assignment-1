assignment about sequence matching and waiting time
1) Please solve Chapter-SM, Exercise 1. 

2) Consider random sequences over the alphabet {R, Y}, where in each position R is drawn with probability p, and Y is drawn with probability q = 1-p.

(i)   Determine the expected waiting time to pattern RR as a function of the parameter p. 
(ii)  Determine the expected waiting time to pattern RY as a function of the parameter p. 
(iii) Calculate the expected waiting times in (i) and (ii) for the cases p=0.5 and p=0.75. Interpret your results. 
(iv)  Submit code to your github site (see below) that determines the mean waiting times in randomly generated sequences. Compare the results with your values determined in (iii).
