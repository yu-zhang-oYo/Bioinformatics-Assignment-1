assignment about sequence matching and waiting time

1) Exercise For the DNA sequence ACGCTGA,

(i) determine the number of mononucleotide permutations;
(ii) find all dinucleotide permutations that also preserve the mononucleotide composition.
(iii) Can you find additional dinucleotide permutations that do not preserve the mononucleotide composition? Explain in general if and when that might be possible.

2) Consider random sequences over the alphabet {R, Y}, where in each position R is drawn with probability p, and Y is drawn with probability q = 1-p.

(i)   Determine the expected waiting time to pattern RR as a function of the parameter p. 
(ii)  Determine the expected waiting time to pattern RY as a function of the parameter p. 
(iii) Calculate the expected waiting times in (i) and (ii) for the cases p=0.5 and p=0.75. Interpret your results. 
(iv)  Submit code to your github site (see below) that determines the mean waiting times in randomly generated sequences. Compare the results with your values determined in (iii).
